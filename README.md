# 🌌 Sky Is the Limit

**Sky Is the Limit** is a space-themed web application that showcases data from NASA's APIs, including the Astronomy Picture of the Day, Mars Rover photos, and real-time Mars weather insights. This project combines modern frontend technologies with real-world data to demonstrate how we can turn raw API responses into engaging, interactive visual experiences.

## 🚀 Why I Built This

I created this project to demonstrate my frontend development skills using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** while working with real-time external APIs. Beyond the technical implementation, _Sky Is the Limit_ is a reflection of my passion for technology, space, and continual learning. The name itself symbolizes my belief that there’s no ceiling to what we can learn or build.

## 🌌 What You'll Find

- Daily **Astronomy Picture of the Day** (APOD) fetched directly from NASA, complete with image, title, and explanation.
- A dynamic **Mars Rover Imagery** section, showing real photos taken by the _Curiosity_ rover with filtering by camera types (excluding MARDI and MAHLI due to image compatibility).
- A detailed **Mars Weather Dashboard** powered by the InSight lander, showing daily temperatures and a polar chart visualizing **wind direction** on Mars.
- Loading states, error handling, and dynamic filtering for a smooth and responsive user experience across all devices.
